            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems play a crucial role in maintaining security within student residences. Strategically placed cameras help monitor common areas, entrances, and exits, providing real-time surveillance and recording any suspicious activities. CCTV systems serve as deterrents and are indispensable in addressing security concerns within the premises.

                Many student residences employ security personnel, either stationed at the main entrance or patrolling the facility round the clock. Trained security guards help maintain order, handle emergencies, and respond promptly to any security threats or concerns. Their presence instills a sense of safety among the residents and acts as a reassuring measure for students and parents alike.

                First and foremost, students living in on-campus residences can benefit from a dedicated internet connection specifically designed to meet their academic needs. These connections are often provided by the university or college, ensuring that students have access to uninterrupted internet service throughout their stay. This provision helps students to complete their assignments, conduct research, participate in virtual classes, and engage with academic resources conveniently from the comfort of their own rooms.

Students' residences often provide Wi-Fi connectivity, extending the reach of the internet throughout the entire building. This enables students to connect their laptops, smartphones, and other devices to the network without the need for wired connections. Access to Wi-Fi grants students the flexibility to study, research, and collaborate from any location within the residence hall, fostering a dynamic and interactive learning environment.

The internet facilities in students' residences are regularly monitored and maintained by IT professionals. This ensures that any technical issues or connectivity problems are promptly addressed, minimizing disruptions to students' academic activities. Students can rely on a dedicated support team to troubleshoot and resolve any internet-related concerns, guaranteeing a smooth online experience.
