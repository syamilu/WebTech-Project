          <h2>Bathroom</h2>
          <p>Shared bathrooms are usually designed to accommodate multiple residents simultaneously. The layout usually includes individual shower stalls, toilet cubicles, and sinks with mirrors. The design aims to optimize space usage and maintain a hygienic environment.</p>
          <p>To ensure cleanliness and hygiene, student residence bathrooms are typically regularly maintained and cleaned by janitorial staff. Cleaning schedules are established to minimize inconvenience to students. Regular maintenance includes the restocking of toiletries, such as toilet paper, soap, and hand towels, to promote a seamless experience for all residents. Additionally, any malfunctioning fixtures or plumbing issues are promptly addressed by maintenance staff.</p>
          <p>To ensure everyone's convenience and comfort, student residences have established guidelines and rules for using shared bathrooms. These typically include expectations regarding cleanliness, respecting others' privacy, and adhering to designated time limits for using the facilities during peak hours.</p>
          <h2>Laundry Room</h2>
          <p>Many students' residences are equipped with well-maintained communal laundry rooms that offer a range of modern and efficient washers and dryers. These laundry facilities are often easily accessible, ensuring that students do not need to leave their residence or rely on external laundromats to keep up with their laundry needs.</p>
          <p>One of the key advantages of laundry facilities in students' residences is their convenience. Since they are often located within the residence building or nearby, students can easily walk to the laundry room without the need to carry heavy loads of laundry across campus or search for off-campus alternatives. This saves time and energy, allowing students to complete their laundry quickly and efficiently.</p>
          <p>Maintenance and cleanliness are also priorities when it comes to laundry facilities in students' residences. Housing management teams regularly inspect and clean the laundry rooms, ensuring that the equipment is in good working condition. They also address any issues promptly, such as malfunctioning machines or broken parts, to ensure that students can always rely on the facilities for their laundry needs.</p>
