          Welcome to the website of Mahallah Salahuddin Al Ayubi

          This website is dedicated to those who want to learn about Mahallah Salahuddin al-Ayyubi (MSA). As a mahallah
          for students under uniform bodies, MSA is also known as the ‘Land of Warriors.’ As the Principal, it is a
          great honor for me to lead and manage these warrior students in terms of their welfare, discipline, and
          programs. My vision as the Principal for MSA is to extend the spirit of Muslim brotherhood and the esprit de
          corps of Salahuddins among the residents.

          There are eight blocks for undergraduate students: four for males (C, D, E, F) and four for females (G, H, I,
          J). An additional block for Post Graduate students provides accommodations, totaling nine blocks for the
          residents. Each male block represents different types of uniform bodies; Block C is for Army cadets, D is for
          male Non-Uniform Bodies students and SISPA trainees, E is for Airforce cadets, and F is for SUKSIS cadets. For
          female blocks, G is for Army cadets, H is for Airforce cadets, I is for SUKSIS, and J is for SISPA trainees
          and female Non-Uniform Bodies.
